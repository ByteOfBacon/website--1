                <p>There are many different ways to organize your code so that your team can understand what you intend to do, including Pseudocode and flowcharts:</p>
                <div>
                    <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
                    <p>
                        The goal of pseudocode is to write down the major phases in an algorithm in a "language" that is nearly as simple as plain English but also 
                        having a logical orderly structure akin to computer code. Variables, decisions, loops, and function calls are examples of pseudocode structures. 
                        The exact syntax isn't important, so programmers may concentrate on the big picture rather than the small insignificant details.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Flowcharts</h3>
                    <p>
                        Flowcharts are diagrams that show how an algorithm works. Typically, rectangular boxes carry the program's executable steps, 
                        while diamonds hold the program's decisions ( branches ). Circles, ovals, or rounded rectangles can be used as starting, stopping, and 
                        continuation points. The flow from one block to the next is shown by arrows.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>These two techniques are ideal for planning out and easier understanding of the code for yourself and your peers.</p>

            <div>
                <p>
                    The logic components of code, which comprise Loops, Algorithms, and Branches, are another collection of crucial components. 
                    These components provide the foundation of code, ensuring that it works properly while also making things easier and faster for you.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <h3>Loops</h3>
                    Loops are programming components that repeat a section of code a predetermined number of times until the intended result is achieved. 
                    When programmers write code, loops allow them to condense hundreds of lines of code into a few simple lines. 
                    This allows them to write the code once and then reuse it as needed, increasing the likelihood that the program will function as planned.
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Algorithms</h3>
                    A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem in such a way that the answer is always accurate. 
                    When there are numerous algorithms for a problem (which there almost always are! ), the best algorithm is usually the one that solves it the quickest.
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Branching</h3>
                    <p>
                        Branching is the process of deciding which path to take in a program. 
                        This is done by using a decision structure, which is a structure that allows a program to make a decision based on a condition. 
                        The decision structure is usually a conditional statement, such as if, else, or switch.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Functions</h3>
                    <p>
                        When a particular set of instructions is needed, a function block can be created to accomplish the task. 
                        Whenever that task is needed, the program references that function. Functions are generally designed to take input, transform it somehow, 
                        and deliver output.
