                There are many different concepts to programming that are essential for the programmer to understand such as identifiers, containers, functions, and objects.

                    <b>Identifiers</b>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Identifiers are the names of variables, functions, and objects. They are used to refer to the objects in the program.</p>

                    <p>An example of an Identifier is a variable. A variable is equivalent to a variable in math. However, in the context of programming, variables are dynamic and can contain both </p>

                    <p>Containers are the ways in which the program can store data. They are used to store data in the program.</p>

                    <p>Functions are the ways in which the program can perform actions. They are used to perform actions in the program.</p>
