                There are many different concepts to programming that are essential for the programmer to understand such as identifiers, containers, functions, and objects.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <div>
                    <h3>Identifiers</h3>
                    <p>Identifiers are the names of variables, functions, and objects. They are used to identify unique parts of a program, or unique classes within it.</p>
                    <p>An example of an Identifier is a variable. A variable is equivalent to a variable in math. However, in the context of programming, 
                        variables are dynamic and can contain different <span class="highlight">datatypes</span>. These include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="display:inline-block; list-style-type: disc;" >Integers</li>
                        <li style="display:inline-block; list-style-type: disc;" >Floats</li>
                        <li style="display:inline-block; list-style-type: disc;" >Strings</li>
                        <li style="display:inline-block; list-style-type: disc;" >Booleans</li>
                        <li style="display:inline-block; list-style-type: disc;" >Arrays</li>
                        <li style="display:inline-block; list-style-type: disc;" >Objects</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        A constant is a variable that cannot be changed. For example, the subject of a  class is a constant, 
                        whereas the number of students in a class can be changed.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Containers</h3>
                    <p>
                        Containers hold things in real life, and they do the same in computer programming. 
                        Variables, which are values that can vary based on different input or conditions within a program, were discussed earlier in this chapter. 
                        When defining a variable, developers are only permitted to specify one value for that variable. 
                        Multiple variables of comparable types can be grouped together and retrieved at the same time using containers. 
                        <span class="highlight">Arrays</span> and <span class="highlight">vectors</span> are the two types of containers you should be aware of.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An array is nothing more than a collection of values. An array has a few fundamental distinguishing characteristics. 
                        To begin, an array's items must all be of the same data type. Second, the array's size is fixed and never changes.
                    <p>
                        A list of values is also stored as a vector. The values do not have to be of the same data type, and vectors can be dynamically created, 
                        which means they can decrease or increase as needed by the program. Otherwise, vectors are similar to arrays in that they store values 
                        and allow retrieval of those values. Vectors are significantly more adaptable than arrays and are the preferred container type because 
                        they may be dynamically scaled.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Functions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Functions are <span style="highlight">reusable</span> code parts that are frequently used by developers. 
                        A function block can be used to execute a task when a specific collection of instructions is required. 
                        The program refers to that function whenever that activity is required. 
                        In general, functions are designed to accept input, transform it in some way, and provide output.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Objects</h3>
                    <p>
                        Objects are a special type of container. They are most common in Object Oriented Programming languages. These languages are centered around objects,
                        and the properties, attributes, and methods in each object, which are then used to perform actions. Object Oriented Languages usually seperate code into
                        two types: the <span class="highlight">class</span> and the <span class="highlight">object</span>. The class defines the properties and methods of the object,
                        'the object' is the actual instance of the class.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Objects contain <span class="highlight">attributes</span> and <span class="highlight">properties</span> Although the words are synonyms, 
                        there are some distinctions. The term properties relates to an object's absolute qualities, whereas attributes refers to additional information about it that can be changed later. 
                        People, for example, have a trait known as height. Depending on the property utilized, height can be stated in a variety of ways, such as 
                        5ft 8in, 173 centimeters, or 1.73 meters. An attribute, for example, could be the color of their shirt. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In coding, <span style="highlight">properties</span> and characteristics are utilized in a variety of ways. 
                        To begin with, a property can be any data type, including text, integer, or Boolean. Code can be used to change the properties of an object. 
                        <span style="highlight">Attributes cannot be altered.</span> If you try to change an attribute's value and then ask for its value to be shown, 
                        the software will return the default value.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Consider methods to be the equivalent of functions for objects. They are methods for coordinating many tasks in order to complete an operation.
                    </p>
