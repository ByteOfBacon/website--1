                    Assembly is a type of code that is difficult to work with due to how close it is to binary it is, but can do a lot due to how close it is to machine code.

                    Compiled languages are languages that get compiled into lower-level code. This means that the language runs faster, but requires a compilation step each time it is edited and run again. 
                    Examples include: The C family (C, C++, C#), Java, and Rust.

                    Interpreted languages are not compiled, and instead are 'interpreted' every time they are run. This means they are slower than compiled languages. 
                    Generally, interpreted languages are easier to work with. Examples include: Pascal, Perl, and Python.

                    Markup languages are commonly used to make webpages, but they are not compiled, meaning that they take longer to load, but take less memory. 
                    They are also easter to debug. Examples include: HTML, CSS, and XML.

                    Scripting languages are languages that are used to make scripts. These are usually single-purpose and are not compiled. Examples include: Bash, Ruby, and PHP.

                    Scripted languages are languages which run inside of other programs, and generally are used to extend the functionality of existing languages. Examples can include Lua and Lisp.
