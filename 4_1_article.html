                    Languages are generally categorized by whether they are "high-level" or "low-level". High-level languages tend to be easier for humans to read, whereas
                    low-level languages are closer to the computer hardware, and can access more resources. A main characteristic of high-level languages is abstraction, where 
                    complicated concepts are abstracted away into simpler commands. For example, higher-level languages often have pre-written functions to perform common tasks.

                    Assembly is a type of code that is made to be as human-readable as possible, while also staying very low-level, close to the machine code run by the CPU.
                    Assembly is specific to each architecture, and is not universal. Examples can include: x86 Assembly ASM, RISC-V Assembly, ARM Assembly, etc.

                    Compiled languages are languages that get compiled into lower-level code. This means that the language runs faster, but requires a compilation step each time it is edited and run again.
                    Compiled languages are popular for their balance of performance and ease of use. Examples include: The C family (C, C++, C#), Java, and Rust.

                    Interpreted languages are not compiled, and instead are 'interpreted' every time they are run. This means they are slower than compiled languages. 
                    Generally, interpreted languages are easier to work with, but take a hit to performance. There are three types of interpreted languages:

                            Markup languages are commonly used to make webpages, but they are not compiled, meaning that they take longer to load, but take less memory. 
                            They are also easter to debug. Examples include: HTML, CSS, and XML.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                            Scripting languages are languages that are used to make scripts. These are usually single-purpose and are not compiled. These depend on a 
                            command interpreter to run, such as a Terminal application or command interpreter. Examples include: Bash, Python, and Javascript.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                            Scripted languages are languages which run inside of other programs, and generally are used to extend the functionality of existing languages. 
                            Examples can include Lua and Lisp.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Query languages are languages that are used to make queries to a database. They can be used to generate reports, and edit data in databases on the fly.
                    Examples include: SQL, and MongoDB.
